Submit your talk as an issue. Just make sure your specifying which month you would like to climb on stage and the title of your talk

P.S. It helps us a lot if we can reach you through public information from your public github profile, if you dont have any listed there also leave your email or twitter handle in the open issue.
Thanks,
