# LNUG Talks

A repo for organising talk proposals and discussing talks with speakers

## Talk Format

- Each event has 3 speaker slots available.  
- Each talk is allocated 20 minutes, however, this can be altered on a per-case basis.
- Talks are recorded and posted onto the LNUG [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-qjgj2TnRoI1ZmFFaN3FeQ) channel.  * Your permission is implied.

## How
Its simple. [Open an issue](https://github.com/lnug/speakers/issues/new) to submit a talk.  

Please structure the issue as following:

- Title: [Talk Title]
- Body: 
  - [Abstract of your talk]
  - [A bit about you, e.g. current job, twitter handle, etc.]

If you are looking for feedback on your talk or have additional question, reply to your issue with  **extra comments** stating your questions but please keep them off the body of the original issue text itself

### Please conform to the issue structure so that we can use the api to automate some of the event admin.

## Confirmation
- Once your issue is assigned a milestone, it has been approved and confirmed.  
- Check the milestone date for confirmation of the event date.

## Code of conduct:
LNUG has a [code of conduct](https://lnug.org/code-of-conduct.html) that speakers as well as attendees are expected to observe - please be sure to read it and comply with it in your participation with LNUG

## After the event
Please tweet a url to your slides and put the link in your proposal as a comment.

Thanks,
<3 LNUGorg team
